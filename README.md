# twitter-clone-app

This is my second React project for my frontend course - a fully functional micro blogging web app (like twitter). The design of home (tweets) page was on assignment at Figma, I've came up with my design for the rest of the pages.
For this assignment I've learnt how to use Firebase: handle authentication, work with cloud storage and with database, and React Router.

Here you can find:

1. register with your mail or google;
2. add a profile picture;
3. add new tweet to common tweet blog;
4. pagination and fancy loader;
5. Context usage;
6. PrivateRoute;

It isn't finished yet since I want to implement a feature that allows the user to display only their own tweets and add some bonus things.
